Choosing a software license sucks, and figuring out how to apply it correctly is
a pain. Here's the solution.

This is a simple Python script to automatically license a project under one of
many popular open source licenses. Simply provide the source directory, the
project name and owner, and the license name, and it adds the license text into
a COPYING file and prepends the right copyright headers to all source files,
correctly escaped with relevant comment syntax.

It also comes with options for further configurability, such as excluding
filetypes or specific directories.

Hint: if you just want attribution but no other restrictions (as I suspect most
people do), I recommend the FreeBSD or MIT licenses.
